### Project Description    
This is my second Data Science project where I analyze job vacancies from the HeadHunter website using SQL.

### What Case Are We Solving?    
The goal of this project is to analyze data to build a machine learning model that will recommend job vacancies to agency clients.

**What we practice**     
    - Solving Data Science cases
    - Reinforcing the material covered in the course
    - Working with SQL and Python


### Brief Data Overview
The data consists of a database with the following tables:
    - vacancies
    - areas (regions)
    - employers
    - industries

### Project Stages  
The project is divided into five stages:
    1) Familiarization with the data
    2) Preliminary data analysis
    3) Detailed analysis of vacancies
    4) Analysis of employers
    5) Subject analysis

All these stages are elaborated in Jupyter Notebook.

### Results:  
The data was properly analyzed through SQL queries and further graphing and data interpretation. As a result, the company will have the opportunity to build a machine learning model to recommend job vacancies.

### Conclusions:  
This project was challenging for me as it required a deep dive into SQL to correctly interpret the data through accurate queries. I believe I have done commendable work, not without its issues and mistakes, but nonetheless.
