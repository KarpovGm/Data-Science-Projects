### Project Description    
First Data Science project. Objective: to solve a business problem involving the analysis of job vacancies from HeadHunter data.

### What Case Are We Solving?    
HeadHunter wants to develop a model that would automatically determine the approximate salary level suitable for a user, based on the information they provide about themselves. However, as is known, before building a model, the data must be transformed, explored, and cleaned. That was my task.

**What we practice**     
    - Solving Data Science cases
    - Reinforcing the material covered in the course


### Brief Data Overview
The data consists of a resume database downloaded from the hh.ru (HeadHunter) job search site.
The database includes information about job seekers such as: Gender, age, desired salary, city of residence, work experience, preferred work schedule, last/current place of work, last/current position, level of education, desired type of employment, car ownership, and willingness (or unwillingness) to relocate.

### Project Stages  
The project is divided into four stages:
    1) Basic analysis of data structure
    2) Data transformation
    3) Exploratory data analysis 
    4) Data cleaning

All these stages are elaborated in Jupyter Notebook.

### Results:  
After performing data transformations and creating charts for exploratory analysis, the company will be able to build a machine learning model, which was required.

### Conclusions:  
The first real Data Science project is completed; I faced quite a number of challenges, but I managed to solve all the tasks set. I delved into the topic and feel that I have well assimilated the material covered in the course prior to this project.
